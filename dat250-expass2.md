 I encountered some issues while implementing the API and testing in bruno.  Initial ECONNREFUSED errors campe up because the server was not running on the expected port. I fixed this by starting Spring Boot and verifying “Tomcat started on port 8080”. A startup failure due to ambiguous route mapping occurred when two @GetMapping methods targeted /api/polls/{pollId}/votes; I removed the duplicate and moved global listing to /api/votes.Also excessive, recursive JSON output occured. I corrected this by annotating all model classes (User, Poll, Vote, VoteOption) with @JsonIdentityInfo(generator = ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class, property = "id"), ensuring Jackson serializes an object once and references it thereafter by id.I encountered a few issues while testing in Bruno like forgetting the order I should test but it was very easy to fix the mistakes.
